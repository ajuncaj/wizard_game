# Wizard Game *(working title)*
My first fully fledged game project! An arcade inspired, platforming, twin stick shooter themed around wizards being pulled through crazy dimensions to get stronger to fight flashy enemies and bosses.

## Technical details
This game's main purpose was to get a solid understanding of godot and how game development works with my pre-existing CS understanding. It's been a fun process, and I look forward to exploring the engine more while building my skillset. Things shown off in this project include:
- **Modular**, well written code base following **industry standards** and **modern software design**
- Major systems include:
  - Enemy & boss handlers
  - Custom built player movement
  - Weapon system utilizing physics and focusing on player experimentation
  - Shop / Upgrade system
  - Levels and hazards
- Optimizations
  - Object pooling
  - Other stuff soon probably!
 

*Note: due to not wanting to deal with licensing and rights issue, a scaled down version is shown here. A packaged excecutable will be available once complete.*
