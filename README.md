# Wizard Game *(working title)*
My first fully fledged game project! An arcade inspired, 2D twin stick shooter themed around wizards being pulled through crazy dimensions in a misguided attempt for power. Fight powerful enemies and flashy bosses as your wizard is jettisoned from wild local to wild local. Go from an interdimensional plane filled with abstract monstrosities, to an empty void filled with murderous machines while strengthening your spells, wand, and attributes. 
### Features:
- Fast paced 2D action
- Custom upgrades for every spell, wand, and character
- Over xxx levels, xxx enemies, and xx spells
- An interdimensional dolphin with cool sunglasses that sells you things. His name is Fin Dolle and he said you owe him money.


## Technical details
This game's main purpose was to get a solid understanding of godot and how game development works with my pre-existing CS understanding. It's been a fun process, and I look forward to exploring the engine more while building my skillset. Things shown off in this project include:
- **Modular**, well written code base following **industry standards** and **modern software design**
- Major systems include:
  - Enemy & boss handlers
  - Custom built player movement
  - Weapon system utilizing physics and focusing on player experimentation
  - Shop / Upgrade system
  - Levels and hazards
- Optimizations
  - Object pooling
  - Other stuff soon probably!
 

*Note: due to not wanting to deal with licensing and rights issue, a scaled down version is shown here. A packaged excecutable will be available once complete.*
